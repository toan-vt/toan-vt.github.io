About
======
I am a master student in Computer Science at The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. I have a broad interest in data mining and its applications. Currently, I am working with Dr. Mina Sartipi on urban computing and intelligent transportation systems. I obtained a bachelor degree in Computer Engineering at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology. During my undergraduate, I spent a summer at TUAT, Tokyo.
